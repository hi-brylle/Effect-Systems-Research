## First-pass summary:
This is a paper showcasing a typesetting application written in [Koka](<Koka-Programming with Row-polymorphic Effect Types>) by the same author of the language (although there was no mention of Koka anywhere in the paper itself). It aims for a typesetting application whose raw structured content is still readable and is independent from the final render options.
