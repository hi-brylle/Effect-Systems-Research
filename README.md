# What is this?
This is a repository of an Obsidian Vault on my research on Effect Systems.
# How to use?
1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download). It's a note-taking application with community plugins for extensibility and a powerful interactive graph view that shows connections amongst the notes you wrote using internal links.
2. Clone this repository using git.
3. Open the Obsidian app. Open a vault. Select the folder where this repo was cloned locally. Obsidian can detect folders with Markdown files in them and this repo is just that (with some  metadata found in the .obsidian folder).
4. `git pull` frequently to update your local copy whenever I make changes/additions.
